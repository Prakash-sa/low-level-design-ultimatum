# Abstract Class and Abstract Method

- An abstract class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly. Think of it as a blueprint for other classes. It often includes one or more abstract methods. A class that inherits from an abstract class must implement all its abstract methods.

- In Python, the abc (Abstract Base Classes) module provides tools for defining abstract base classes. An abstract base class is a class that cannot be instantiated directly and often includes one or more abstract methods. These classes serve as blueprints for other classes, enforcing a consistent interface for a group of derived classes. By defining common behavior in abstract base classes, we ensure that derived classes follow the same protocol, making our code more predictable and robust.

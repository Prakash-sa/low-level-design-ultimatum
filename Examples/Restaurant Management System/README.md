# 🍽️ Restaurant Management System - Interview Guide

## Overview
Restaurant system with tables, orders, menu, and billing

## Core Entities
- Table, MenuItem, Order, Chef, Waiter

## Key Design Patterns
1. **Singleton** - Ensures single instance of system
2. **Strategy** - Flexible algorithms for different operations
3. **Observer** - Real-time notifications and updates
4. **State** - Clear state transitions and management
5. **Factory** - Object creation and type handling
6. **Command/Decorator** - Complex operations and enhancements

## SOLID Principles
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Each class has one reason to change
- **O**pen/Closed: Open for extension, closed for modification
- **L**iskov Substitution: Subclasses properly substitute parents
- **I**nterface Segregation: Focused, cohesive interfaces
- **D**ependency Inversion: Depend on abstractions, not concretions

## Interview Preparation
1. Study the 75_MINUTE_GUIDE.md for step-by-step implementation
2. Run INTERVIEW_COMPACT.py to see working demos
3. Review START_HERE.md for quick reference and talking points
4. Practice explaining design patterns and architectural decisions

## Key Takeaways
✅ Modular, extensible architecture
✅ Clear separation of concerns
✅ Observable patterns for notifications
✅ Strategy pattern for flexible behaviors
✅ Singleton for system-wide resources

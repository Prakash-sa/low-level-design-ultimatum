## 💡 Key Learnings Across All Systems

### Singleton Pattern (Use When)
- Need exactly one instance of a resource
- Examples: ATM machine, ParkingLot, LibrarySystem, Hotel, Restaurant

### Strategy Pattern (Use When)
- Multiple algorithms for same operation
- Examples: Pricing strategies, payment methods, search algorithms

### Observer Pattern (Use When)
- Need to notify multiple listeners of changes
- Examples: Display boards, email notifications, real-time updates

### State Pattern (Use When)
- Object behavior changes based on state
- Examples: Ticket status, room availability, game phases

### Factory Pattern (Use When)
- Complex object creation logic
- Examples: Vehicle creation, payment method creation, order types

### Decorator Pattern (Use When)
- Want to add features dynamically
- Examples: Premium member benefits, VIP parking, extra services

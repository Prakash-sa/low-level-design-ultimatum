## 4. Design a Leaderboard
Build an in-memory leaderboard for a fantasy-sports style app. Each user creates exactly one team made up of one or more players.

You must support querying the Top-K users ranked by score.

## 8. Design a restaurant food ordering system
Design a restaurant food ordering and rating system, similar to food delivery apps like Zomato, Swiggy, Door Dash, Uber Eats etc.

There will be food items like ‘Veg Burger’, ‘Veg Spring Roll’, ‘Ice Cream’ etc.

And there will be restaurants from where you can order these food items.

Same food item can be ordered from multiple restaurants. e.g. you can order ‘food-1’ ‘veg burger’ from burger king as well as from McDonald’s.

Users can order food, rate orders, fetch restaurants with most rating and fetch restaurants with most rating for a particular food item e.g. restaurants which have the most rating for ‘veg burger’.

# Design Patterns (Python) — Refined Examples

This folder contains concise, runnable examples of common design patterns in Python. Each subfolder includes a small script (`*.py`) and (where helpful) a short README.

Patterns covered:
- Behavioral: Command, Iterator, Observer, Strategy
- Creational: Singleton, Factory, Builder, Abstract Factory
- Structural: Adapter, Composite, Decorator, Facade
- Resilience: Circuit Breaker (stub)

Quick start: run any `*.py` directly, e.g.

```
python3 "Behavioral/Command/command.py"
python3 "Behavioral/Observer/Observer.py"
python3 "Structural/Composite/composite.py"
python3 "Structural/Decorator/decorator.py"
```

Each example favors clarity over completeness and demonstrates the essence of the pattern with a minimal scenario.
